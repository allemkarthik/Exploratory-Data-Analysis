500 Richest People in the World - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset of the 500 richest people in the world, which was sourced from Kaggle. The analysis uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to explore, clean, and visualize various trends and insights regarding the wealth of these individuals.

Project Overview
This EDA project aims to analyze the distribution of wealth among the 500 richest people globally and extract meaningful insights. The dataset provides information on various factors such as net worth, industry, country, and other demographic details of the richest individuals.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
NumPy: Numerical computing library for efficient array manipulation.
Matplotlib: Data visualization library for creating charts and graphs.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for creating and presenting the analysis in an interactive manner.
Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of information about the top 500 richest people in the world. The dataset contains columns like:

Name
Net worth (in billions)
Country
Industry
Age
Source of wealth
Rank
You can access the dataset on Kaggle via this link: 500 Richest People Dataset

Features & Insights
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and any outliers in the data.
Wealth Distribution: Visualization of the distribution of net worth of the 500 richest individuals.
Top Countries: Identifying countries with the highest concentration of the richest individuals.
Industry Breakdown: Analysis of the industries that contribute to the wealth of these individuals.
Age vs Net Worth: Exploring the correlation between age and net worth.
